It's done! I finally finished my first project! 

I will be honest and firstly say, boy was I in for a whirlwind of emotions. When all was finished it was the greatest relief I have had in the longest time. With the help and learning from my fellow mates I was able to navigate around and get a better undertsanding of what needed to be done. There was a lot that I had done since I was in between wether scraping for this project or using an API. In the end I chose an API to get a better flow of things and better understand myself. 

The first thing I did of course was create a new file on my computer, this is where I want all of my other coding files to be in so that way they are all nested in together and aren't seperated around. After that got started I ran the **Bundle Install** with the name of the my working file. Once all the gems got filed into one large portion I saw that it carried several files like **Readme.md**, **Gemspec**, **gemfile** and other files included that are necessary for the rest of the program. 

Throughout the project I did use our helpful friend **Google** in order to reiterate whatever we learned and as well went over the labs again in order to understand the coding. 

Once all was finished I pushed everything onto GitHub and got all the files saved and ready to share for the project review. I do greatly appreciate this though since I was able to go over everything and incorporate all those things I had learned through the recent months and be able to show it in project form.
