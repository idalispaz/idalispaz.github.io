So! We were asked, "Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?" for our first post and so here it is guys! 
Honestly...I wanted to challenge myself. I have been with the same company making drinks for everyone for about a good 5 years now. I have changed my majors around quite a few times it's embarassing. I finally stuck to one major which was Graphics Informative Technology. From there I learned a bit of everything so far, such as Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Photography and etc. 

The one that stuck out the most to me when I was taking all these classes was the "Introduction to Web Design" class. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but it sounded interesting. I will be honest though, I failed the first time. I didn't have the actual textbook only the PDF and my gosh was that difficult. Only then did I realized that having the actually copy would have made me pass the first time since the second time around I got the hard copy and kept flipping through pages whenever I needed help and that wasn't possible with a PDF, just letting you know, gotta be careful with that, but lets move along shall we? 

When I was taking that class, it was basically just HTML5 & CSS. It looked like jumbo to me when I first started it, but as I kept working on the website we were all making together, slowly it began to stick and I was able to understand the concepts. Since then, I have been fascinated with it! I know it was just the basics, but ever since I have been looking around to see whatelse I could learn. Though I did have a pretty hectic schedule then I couldn't really get a grasp of everything, but that's when I decided. I decided to take the big leap, to challenge myself, and let me tell you...it is quite the challenge. It's already been two weeks and I already asked myself "Why did you do this?"

Though I did ask myself then and then again why, I knew that I had to continue. This is what the challenge was and I was ready for it! I am ready to learn it all and study it all and create anything I can with it. I want to be able to ask all these questions and be able to answer them. I know it will be a tough journey and a roller coaster wide, but I'm excited. 

I decided to study Software Engineering so I could make things. So I can see it come to life while I was working on it. Being able to see something that you worked on being useful is a great feeling. I may bang my head on the wall a bit too many times for my liking, but in the end I feel happy when the things pass. I do aks myself how and why so that way I keep learning and striving. 

I might fail a few times, but I have always been told that failing is okay. It's how we learn from our mistakes and from that we strive for better and work harder. It's only the beginning right now and I am really looking foward to the future. It will become a great outcome I'd like to believe.
